      EN TITLE The National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts and Primary Medical Services Section 17C Agreements) (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Scotland) Regulations 2023
      SUMMARY The National Health Service (General Medical Services Contracts) Regulations 2018 (the “principal GMS Regulations”) set out for Scotland the framework for general medical contracts into which Health Boards may enter under section 17J of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act”). The principal GMS Regulations provide, amongst other things, that a contractor may refuse to accept an application for patient registration where they have reasonable grounds. Regulation 2 makes amendments to the principal GMS Regulations which apply in relation to people who are about to be released from prison, a young offenders institution or the state hospital. The effect of that amendment is that a contractor cannot refuse that person’s application on the grounds that they currently do not live in the contractors area at the time of their application, if they will live in the contractor’s practice area on their release. In addition regulation 2 makes an amendment to interpretation provision to remove a redundant provision.
